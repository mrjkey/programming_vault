Please provide an Obsidian note for the CodeWars kata we discussed using the following format:

1. Title: 'CodeWars Kata - [Kata Name]'
2. Link to the kata - put in a placeholder
3. Problem Statement section.
4. Solution section, which includes:
    - The solution code.
    - Explanation of the code.
5. Key Concepts section, highlighting important functions or methods used and their brief descriptions.
6. Tags relevant to the kata, formatted to capture specific data types, data structures, algorithms, and concepts. For example, if a solution includes the use of `std::set`, the tag should be `#std/set` to indicate both the standard library (`std`) and the specific data structure or type (`set`).

Ensure the note has headers, code blocks, and other relevant formatting, and is optimized for direct copy-pasting into a markdown document without any additional modifications. Only produce the note and do not wrap the entire note in "```" as this needs to be removed manually. Only use this for code sections. 

Exclude any additional headers, footers, or introductory and concluding statements
