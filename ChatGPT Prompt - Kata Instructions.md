For the given CodeWars kata or algorithmic problem, I'm seeking a solution that:

1. **Leverages Built-in C++ STL Algorithms and Functions**: Before creating a custom implementation, are there existing algorithms or functions in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that can be leveraged to simplify or optimize the solution?
2. **Utilizes Containers Efficiently**: Which STL containers are best suited for this problem? Can their inherent properties (like automatic deduplication in `std::set`, or constant time lookup in `std::unordered_map`) be used to optimize the solution?
3. **Focuses on Idiomatic C++**: The solution should align with modern C++ best practices. It should be concise, readable, and effectively leverage the features of the language.
4. **Minimizes Redundant Operations**: Check if there are steps or operations in the algorithm that can be reduced or eliminated by smartly using C++ STL functions or containers.
5. **Educational Value**: Alongside the solution, include explanations or references for the specific STL algorithms, functions, or containers used. This will help in understanding their application and deepening knowledge of C++.
6. The solution should be understandable: Given that problems can have many solutions, always tend toward the solution that is easiest to understand unless that is a bad solution.
