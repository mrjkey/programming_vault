"Some of us might feel or experience it sometimes" - is this about happiness, or about the list below?

---
If the sentence is about happiness, maybe something like "We all may feel or experience happiness sometimes, but we also experience:"
* Stress
* Fear
* ...
* Toxic self-talk

---
If the sentence is about the list, then maybe "Sometimes we will feel or experience"
* Stress
* Fear
* ...



Since this is a speech feel free to say whatever feels natural, I just thought I might reword this slightly: 

"These experiences are inflicted by our inborn evolutionary performance. We feel the need to safeguard ourselves; we overvalue our social status; or have an intrinsic constraint to accomplish something"

wasn't sure what you meant by "Must-see performances", but I hope I got the right direction.



# Slide 6

 
"We are fully justified by our being alone"
"Meaning and purpose come into this world with human consciousness, and all connected chains running back into it"
"Every living, conscious being is the highest and ultimate purpose in itself"
"We have to give life its own meaning, and stop searching for it outside of us"


# Slide 7

"Ultimately, the only meaning in life can be to enjoy life and be happy"
"Otherwise the entire event of life would make no sense"
"We have a basic desire for happiness "
	"Not in a selfish or hedonistic way"
	"It is simply a natural expression of our essential nature"



# Slide 8
If happiness is our basic desire:
Then it is the main purpose of life
Then we are here to experience happiness
Then we are meant to find it in all areas of our lives


# Slide 9

Satisfaction; an internal source

Life satisfaction comes from internal sources
Happiness starts with the realization, that we don't depend on the external circumstances, surrounding us
Happiness can be developed within ourselves
it is a decision we make by…
… accepting who we are
… being here and now
… connecting to our inner potential and wealth
… developing a conductive mindset


# Slide 10

Happiness is True Only When Shared

Happiness is not something that we should keep to ourselves
It feels only truly real when it is shared with others

Sharing our happiness creates a ripple effect, which is bringing us together and allows us to make connection

# Slide 11

Love is the Key to Happiness

Love is the force that unites us
When we love others, we are opening our hearts
This is the only way to truly connect with others
And experience the true joy of happiness


# Slide 12

Conclusion

Happiness is the main purpose of life
It is something that we are all meant to experience and to share with each other
And love is the key
