"Some of us might feel or experience it sometimes" - is this about happiness, or about the list below?

---
If the sentence is about happiness, maybe something like "We all may feel or experience happiness sometimes, but we also experience:"
* Stress
* Fear
* ...
* Toxic self-talk

---
If the sentence is about the list, then maybe "Sometimes we will feel or experience"
* Stress
* Fear
* ...



Since this is a speech feel free to say whatever feels natural, I just thought I might reword this slightly: 
"These feelings are inflicted by an evolutionary inborn “Must-see performances”, like safeguarding ourselfs, overvalue our social status or the intrinsic constraint to accomplish something"
